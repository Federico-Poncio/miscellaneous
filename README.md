Various notebooks !

We have the following ones now:
1. Newton_Raphson_andChaos : this is a notebook for one of the classes of my math course where we explore the theory of newton Raphson and use this notebook to see some examples and have the students try it out. We also start looking into recursions and chaos theory.
2. NLP_limpieza_de_datos_imdb : a notebook for natural language processing, in particular for the first data preparation step, with data coming from IMDB movies. This is part of a bigger project soon to be uploaded as well.
3. FourierBrownianBridge :  an exploration of the fourier frequencies of brownian bridges, and also circular brownian motion in 3D. The motivation behind this was seeing which frequencies were most common under many samples of brownian bridges, in order to get an idea of how such coefficients are distributed statistically.
